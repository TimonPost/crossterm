Ever got disappointed when a terminal library for rust was only written for unix systems? 
Crossterm provides the same core functionalities for both windows and unix systems.

Crossterm aims to be simple and easy to call in code. 
Though the simplicity of Crossterm, you do not have to worry about the platform you are working with.
You can just call whatever action you want and behind the scenes it will check what to do based on the current platform.

This crate supports all unix and windows terminals down to windows XP (not all terminals are tested see 'Tested Terminals' for more info)

## Getting Started

This documentation is only for Crossterm version `0.4.0` if you have an older version of Crossterm I suggest you check the [Upgrade Manual](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm/blob/master/docs/UpgradeManual.md) for more information about how to upgrade to a newer version or check the [examples](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm/tree/master/examples) folders which contains a readme for every specific version. Also, you could take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm/tree/master/examples) from the previous versions of Crossterm.


Add the Crossterm package to your `Cargo.toml` file.

```
[dependencies]
crossterm = "0.4.0"

```
And import the Crossterm modules you want to use.

```rust  
extern crate crossterm;

// this module is used for styling the terminal
use self::crossterm::style::*;
// this module is used for cursor related actions
use self::crossterm::cursor::*;
// this mudule is used for terminal related actions
use self::crossterm::terminal::*;

```

### Crossterm wrapper | [see more](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm/blob/master/examples/Crossterm%200.3.0/crossterm_type/mod.rs)
This is a wrapper for the modules crossterm provides. This is introduced to manage the [`Context`](link_to_context) for the user.
```
let crossterm = Crossterm::new();

// get instance of the modules, whereafter you can use the methods the particulary module provides. 
let color = crossterm.color();
let cursor = crossterm.cursor();
let terminal = crossterm.terminal();

// write text to console wheter it be the main screen or the alternate screen.
crossterm.write("some text");
// print some styled font.
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Red font on blue background").with(Color::Red).on(Color::Blue));
```
### Styled font | [see more](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm/blob/master/examples/Crossterm%200.3.0/color/mod.rs)
This module provides the functionalities to style the terminal cursor.
```rust    
use crossterm::style::{Color};
use crossterm::Crossterm; 
    
// Crossterm provides method chaining so that you can style the font nicely.
// the `with()` methods sets the foreground color and the `on()` methods sets the background color
// You can either store the styled font.
   
// create instance of `Crossterm`
let crossterm = Crossterm::new();

// store style in styled object and print it
let mut styledobject = crossterm.paint("stored styled font in variable").with(Color::Green).on(Color::Yellow);
println!("{}",styledobject);

// Or you can print it directly.
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Red font on blue background color").with(Color::Red).on(Color::Blue));
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Red font on default background color").with(Color::Red));
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Default font color on Blue background color").on(Color::Blue));

/// The following code can only be used for unix systems:

// Set background Color from RGB
println!("RGB (10,10,10): \t {}", crossterm.paint("  ").on(Color::Rgb {r: 10, g: 10, b: 10}));
// Set background Color from RGB
println!("ANSI value (50): \t {}", crossterm.paint("  ").on(Color::AnsiValue(50)));

// Use attributes to syle the font.
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Normal text"));
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Bold text").bold());
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Italic text").italic());
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Slow blinking text").slow_blink());
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Rapid blinking text").rapid_blink());
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Hidden text").hidden());
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Underlined text").underlined());
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Reversed color").reverse());
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Dim text color").dim());
println!("{}", crossterm.paint("Crossed out font").crossed_out());
```
### Cursor | [see more](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm/blob/master/examples/Crossterm%200.3.0/cursor/mod.rs)
This module provides the functionalities to work with the terminal cursor.

```rust 

use crossterm::Context;
use crossterm::cursor::cursor;

// create context to pass to the `cursor()` function.
let context = Context::new();
let mut cursor = cursor(&context);

/// Moving the cursor | demo
// Set the cursor to position X: 10, Y: 5 in the terminal
cursor.goto(10,5);

// Move the cursor to position 3 times to the up in the terminal
cursor.move_up(3);

// Move the cursor to position 3 times to the right in the terminal
cursor.move_right(3);

// Move the cursor to position 3 times to the down in the terminal
cursor.move_down(3);

// Move the cursor to position 3 times to the left in the terminal
cursor.move_left(3);

// Print an character at X: 10, Y: 5 (see examples for more explanation why to use this method).
// cursor.goto(10,5).print("@");

/// Safe the current cursor position to recall later | demo
// Goto X: 5 Y: 5
cursor.goto(5,5);
// Safe cursor position: X: 5 Y: 5
cursor.save_position();
// Goto X: 5 Y: 20
cursor.goto(5,20);
// Print at X: 5 Y: 20.
print!("Yea!");
// Reset back to X: 5 Y: 5.
cursor.reset_position();
// Print 'Back' at X: 5 Y: 5.
print!("Back");

// hide cursor
cursor.hide();
// show cursor
cursor.show();
// blink or not blinking of the cursor (not widely supported)
cursor.blink(true)

```

### Terminal | [see more](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm/blob/master/examples/Crossterm%200.3.0/terminal/terminal.rs)
This module provides the functionalities to work with the terminal in general.

```rust 
use crossterm::terminal::{terminal,ClearType};
use crossterm::Context;

let mut context = Context::new();
let mut terminal = terminal(&context);

// Clear all lines in terminal;
terminal.clear(ClearType::All);
// Clear all cells from current cursor position down.
terminal.clear(ClearType::FromCursorDown);
// Clear all cells from current cursor position down.
terminal.clear(ClearType::FromCursorUp);
// Clear current line cells.
terminal.clear(ClearType::CurrentLine);
// Clear all the cells until next line.
terminal.clear(ClearType::UntilNewLine);

// Get terminal size
let terminal_size = terminal.terminal_size();
// Print results
print!("X: {}, y: {}", terminal_size.0, terminal_size.1);

// Scroll down 10 lines.
terminal.scroll_down(10);

// Scroll up 10 lines.
terminal.scroll_up(10);

// Set terminal size
terminal.set_size(10,10);

// exit the current process.
terminal.exit();

// write to the terminal whether you are on the main screen or alternate screen.
terminal.write("Some text\n Some text on new line");

// use the `paint()` for styling font
println!("{}", terminal.paint("x").with(Color::Red).on(Color::Blue));
```

## Tested terminals

- Windows Powershell
    - Windows 10 (pro)
- Windows CMD
    - Windows 10 (pro)
- Ubuntu Desktop Terminal
    - Ubuntu 17.10
- Arch linux Konsole

This crate supports all Unix terminals and windows terminals down to Windows XP but not all of them have been tested.
If you have used this library for a terminal other than the above list without issues feel free to add it to the above list, I really would appreciate it.
    
## How it works
Crossterm is using ANSI escape codes by default for both Unix and Windows systems. 
But for Windows, it is a bit more complicated since Windows versions 8 or lower are not supporting ANSI escape codes. This is why we use WinApi for those machines. For Windows 10 ANSI codes will be the default.

## Notice 
This library is not stable yet but I expect it to not to change that much anymore. 
And if there are any changes that affect previous versions I will [describe](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm/blob/master/docs/UpgradeManual.md) what to change when upgrading Crossterm to a newer version.

## Todo
I still have some things in mind to implement. 

- Handling mouse events 

    I want to be able to do something based on the clicks the user has done with its mouse.
- Handling key events

    I want to be able to read key combination inputs. 
- reading from the console.

    I want to be able to read the input of the console.
- Error handling

    Currently, I am not doing that much with returned errors. This is bad since I suspect that everything is working. I want to manage this better. When you build this crate you will see the warnings about not used return values. This is what needs to be improved.
- Tests

    Also, I want to have tests for this crate, and yes maybe a little late :). But I find it difficult to test some functionalities because how would you ever test if the screen is indeed int alternate, raw modes or how would you ever test if the terminal cursor is moved certainly.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Crossterm, than please design the code as it is now. 
For example, a module like cursor has the following file structure:
- mod.rs

  This file contains some trait, in this case, `ITerminalCursor`, for other modules to implement. So that it can work at a specific platform.
  
- cursor.rs

  The end user will call this module to access the cursor functionalities. This module will decide which implementation to use based on the current platform.
- winapi_cursor

  This is the cursor trait (located in mod.rs) implementation with WinApi.
- ansi_cursor

  This is the cursor trait (located in mod.rs) implementation with ANSI escape codes.
  
The above structure is the same for the terminal, color, manager modules. 

Why I have chosen for this design:
- Because you can easily extend to multiple platforms by implementing the trait int the mod.rs.
- You keep the functionalities for different platforms separated in different files. 
- Also, you have one API the user can call like in the `cursor.rs` above. This file should be avoided to change that much. All the other code could change a lot because it has no impact on the user side.
  
I highly appreciate it when you are contributing to this crate. Also Since my native language is not English my grammar and sentence order will not be perfect. So improving this by correcting these mistakes will help both me and the reader of the docs.
