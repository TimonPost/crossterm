//! This module is used for enabling and disabling raw mode for the terminal.
//!
//! What exactly is raw state:
//! - No line buffering.
//!    Normally the terminals uses line buffering. This means that the input will be send to the terminal line by line.
//!    With raw mode the input will be send one byte at a time.
//! - Input
//!   All input has to be written manually by the programmer.
//! - Characters
//!   The characters are not processed by the terminal driver, but are sent straight through.
//!   Special character have no meaning, like backspace will not be interpret as backspace but instead will be directly send to the terminal.
//!
//! With these modes you can easier design the terminal screen.
