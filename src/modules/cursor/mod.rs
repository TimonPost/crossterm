//! With this module you can perform actions that are cursor related.
//! Like moving the cursor position;saving and resetting the cursor position; hiding showing and control the blinking of the cursor.

///! This trait defines the actions that can be preformed with the terminal cursor.

///! ## For example:
///!
///! This trait is implemented for `WINAPI` (Windows specific) and `ANSI` (Unix specific),
///! so that cursor related actions can be preformed on both unix and windows systems.
