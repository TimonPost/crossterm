//! This module provides one place to work with the screen.
//!
//!   In Rust we can call `stdout()` to get an handle to the current default console handle.
//!   For example when in unix systems you want to print something to the main screen you can use the following code:
//!
//!   ```
//!   write!(std::io::stdout(), "{}", "some text").
//!   ```
//!
//!   But things change when we are in alternate screen modes.
//!   We can not simply use `stdout()` to get a handle to the alternate screen, since this call returns the current default console handle (mainscreen).
//!
//!   Instead we need to store an handle to the screen output.
//!   This handle could be used to put into alternate screen modes and back into main screen modes.
//!   Through this stored handle Crossterm can execute its command on the current screen whether it be alternate screen or main screen.
//!
//!   For unix systems we store the handle gotten from `stdout()` for windows systems that are not supporting ANSI escape codes we store WinApi `HANDLE` struct witch will provide access to the current screen.
//!
//! This is the reason why this module exits: it is to provide access to the current terminal screen whether it will be the alternate screen and main screen.
