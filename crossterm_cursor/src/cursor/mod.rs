//! A module that contains all the actions related to cursor movement in the terminal.
//! Like: moving the cursor position; saving and resetting the cursor position; hiding showing and control the blinking of the cursor.
//!
//! Note that positions of the cursor are 0 -based witch means that the coordinates (cells) starts counting from 0

///! This trait defines the actions that can be performed with the terminal cursor.

///! ## For example:
///!
///! This trait is implemented for `WinApi` (Windows specific) and `ANSI` (Unix specific),
///! so that cursor related actions can be performed on both UNIX and Windows systems.
