This folder will contain some examples of how to use this crate in an real live environment. 

If you have created a game or something feel free to upload it, would be a great help for other people and me to make this crate better!

The programs are:

- First depth search: 
  This is an search algorithm implemented visually. This program uses the following functionalities: cursor movement, coloring, alternate screen and terminal clearing. 
- Duplex: This is a terminal application where there is some kind of conterminous output and with async input. So you could type an command while text is being outputted.
- This is an async logging program to demonstrate asynchronous working with crossterm.
